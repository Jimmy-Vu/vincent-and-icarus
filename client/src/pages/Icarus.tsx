        <p className="mb-5">Welcome to the Icarus page! Feeling confident and ready to take on the world? We&apos;ve all been there.
        But sometimes, our confidence can get the best of us, and that&apos;s where Icarus comes in to keep us from flying too close to the sun.</p>
        <p className="mb-5">Icarus was a character from Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun, despite his father&apos;s warnings. His wings,
        made of feathers and wax, melted, and he fell back to earth. But don&apos;t worry, we&apos;re not here to bring you down. In fact, we&apos;re here to help you soar!</p>
        <p className="mb-5">With Icarus, you can embrace your confidence and ambition, but still keep your feet on the ground. Icarus reminds us that
        there&apos;s a fine line between being confident and being overconfident, and he&apos;s here to help you stay on the right side of that line.</p>
        <p className="mb-5">So, why did we choose Icarus to represent the mood of confidence and overconfidence? Because he knows what it&apos;s like to
        want to reach for the stars, but also knows the importance of staying grounded. With Icarus on your side, you can shoot for the moon and achieve great
        things, but you&apos;ll also be reminded to keep a level head and not let your ambition get the best of you.</p>
        <p className="mb-5">So, go ahead and channel your inner Icarus. With his help, you can achieve anything you set your mind to, while still staying safe and grounded.</p>
